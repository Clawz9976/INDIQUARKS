## Notes

- This program uses `system("start URL")` to open URLs in the default web browser, which works on Windows. If you're using Linux or macOS, you may need to modify the `system` command to use `xdg-open` or `open` respectively.
- The trivia questions are pre-defined in the code and consist of multiple-choice questions related to cybersecurity.
